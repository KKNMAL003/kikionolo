# 🏗️ TASKMASTER: Core & Messaging System Refactor

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS

- **DRY/KISS PROTOCOLS**: Every line of code must follow Don't Repeat Yourself and Keep It Simple, Stupid. No exceptions.
- **ZERO DUPLICATION**: All replaced or duplicate files MUST be removed from the codebase - NO EXCEPTIONS.
- **CLEAN SLATE**: No fallbacks, no legacy code support, no backward compatibility layers.
- **PRODUCTION READY**: Code must function cleanly out of the box for unreleased product.
- **PROGRESS TRACKING**: Update status after each task completion. This document is the single source of truth for implementation progress.

## 🏁 PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & ARCHITECTURE (Weeks 1-2)

### 1. Centralized Configuration
- [ ] Create `config/` directory with `index.ts`, `api.ts`, `features.ts`, `ui.ts`
- [ ] Replace all hardcoded values and scattered env vars with config references
- [ ] Validate env vars at startup; fail fast if missing

### 2. Type Safety & Validation
- [ ] Enforce TypeScript strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- [ ] Centralize all types in `types/`
- [ ] Remove all `any` types; add missing type definitions
- [ ] Install and configure Zod for runtime validation
- [ ] Create `validation/schemas/` for all data types
- [ ] Integrate Zod schemas with forms and service layer

### 3. Error Handling Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` and `components/ErrorFallback.tsx`
- [ ] Create `utils/errorReporting.ts` for logging/reporting
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns in all services and UI
- [ ] Add global error boundary at the app root

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] Add test utilities and mocks
- [ ] Write initial unit tests for core services and contexts

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS (see PRD for details)
- DRY score > 95%, cyclomatic complexity < 10, 100% TypeScript strict compliance
- Bundle size < 2MB gzipped, app startup <2s
- 99.9% success rate for message operations, <0.1% error rate, >90% test coverage
- 40% reduction in bug reports, 30% faster onboarding, onboarding <1 day

## 📝 NOTES
- All replaced or duplicate files MUST be removed from the codebase - NO EXCEPTIONS.
- Keep this document updated after every task. Clean, DRY, simple code only.
- No fallbacks, no legacy code, no duplication. This is an unreleased product and must function cleanly out of the box.

---

## 🏁 PHASE 4: COMPONENT & DESIGN SYSTEM (Weeks 7-8)

### 1. Design System Foundation
- [ ] Create theme system (colors, typography, spacing)
- [ ] Replace constants/colors.ts and all color references with theme values
- [ ] Build base components (Button, Input, Card, Text) in components/base/
- [ ] Replace legacy UI components with new base components

### 2. Platform-Specific Code Consolidation
- [ ] Consolidate platform-specific components (e.g., chat) into a single, adaptive implementation
- [ ] Ensure mobile/web parity and accessibility
